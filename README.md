# MACHINE-LEARNING
This repository is all about MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS.
The algorithms that are executed are:
  1. Linear Regression
  2. Logistic Regression
  3. Decision Tree
  4. K-Nearest Neighbors
  5. Random Forest
  6. Support Vector Machine


All the algorithms are in python3.


I have executed these algorithms in google colab; as it doesnt require the hassles of installing any library or packages.


Although, the algorithms can be executed in jupyter notebook available through anaconda software.


I will attach the link to download the anaconda software:
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/


Cookies has to be enabled for the software to be downloaded.


I have also uploaded a presentation for better understanding of the algorithms and also has the basics of machine learning i.e., 
  introduction to machine learning,
  types of machine learning - supervised learning, unsupervised learing and reinforcement learning,
  Regression, Classification and Association,
  Steps involved in machine learning program.
